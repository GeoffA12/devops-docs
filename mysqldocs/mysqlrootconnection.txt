Section 2: Logging into mysql as a root user

For this guide, i'm assuming that you've already learned how to login to both our supply and demand servers. If you haven't already done this, go
and read the loginssh.txt file in this repo. 

This guide will be fairly short as we'll only cover the commands you'll need to open a connection to either the team22 supply or demand database. 

Opening a connection a connection to our MySQL demand instance

1. Login to our demand droplet

2. Open the connection to MySQL using port 6022

Run this command in your terminal,

mysql -u root -p -s -h 127.0.0.1 --port 6022

You should now be prompted for a password. The password for our root user is simply: 

password

After entering this in, you should be connected to our demand database. 

3. Type in this command in the mysql shell to connect to our team22 demand database

use team22demand;

You now have access to query or update any of the tables in our demand database.

Opening a connection to our MySQL supply instance

4. Login to our supply droplet. 

5. Repeat steps 2-3.

Use the same command to setup a TCP connection with our MySQL instance on port 6022,

mysql -u root -p -s -h 127.0.0.1 --port 6022

Enter the same password as before.

6. Type in this command to connect to our team22 supply database

use team22supply;
