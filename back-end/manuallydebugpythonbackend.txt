How to Manually debug/test your back-end python handlers

For this guide i'll be covering the basic techniques i've found useful to manually test back-end files on our server.
If you find yourself needing to test inside our root directory on nginx, i'd prefer that you test and make modifications in your own git branch, 
unless there's extenuating circumstances.

1. Login to either the supply or demand server via ssh

2. Navigate to our root nginx directory

cd /var/www/demand.team22.softwareengineeringii.com/html

OR 

cd /var/www/supply.team22.softwareengineeringii.com/html

3. Type the 'ls' command to see all of our repositories. This is the directory i've cloned all of our repositories to. 

4. Navigate to the repo you want to test and change branches if necessary using

git checkout YourName

5. Find the folder with the python back-end file that you need to manually test. Enter this command to fire up the script 

python3 fileName.py

You should get a message from the terminal confirming that the script is running on a specific port. 

6. Go to your browser and start interacting with the webpage. Open up your terminal screen to see the output. 

I highly recommend putting in print statements along different paths of your python code when debugging. 

7. Stop the script by using the keyboard interrupt Ctrl + c

8. Make modifications if necessary using a built in text editor on ubuntu like Nano 

sudo nano fileName.py

9. Repeat steps 5-8 until the code is refactored and working
